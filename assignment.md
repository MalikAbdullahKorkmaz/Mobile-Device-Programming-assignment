# Mobile Device Programming - Assignment

## Project: Create your own API & Fetch it

**Name:** Abdullah Malik Korkmaz
**NIM/CLASS:** 20230040342/TI23T

### Changes Implemented:

1.  **Custom Mock API Creation:**
    *   A custom API was created using **MockAPI.io** to fulfill the assignment requirement.
    *   **API Endpoint:** `https://69035dfdd0f10a340b23e7ba.mockapi.io/songlist/songs`
    *   **Resource Name:** `songs`
    *   **Data Structure:** The API was designed to return a list of objects with the following fields, to match the data structure expected by the `SongListScreen.js` component:
        *   `id`: Object ID (Auto-generated by MockAPI)
        *   `title`: Song Title (Generated using `lorem.sentence`)
        *   `artist`: Artist Name (Generated using `company.name`)
        *   `album`: Album Name (Generated using `commerce.productName`)

2.  **Mobile Application Update:**
    *   The `src/screens/SongListScreen.js` file was updated to replace the previous placeholder API (`https://ghibliapi.vercel.app/locations`) with the new custom MockAPI endpoint.
    *   The data mapping logic was adjusted to directly use the `title`, `artist`, and `album` fields from the new API response, as the new API structure is a direct match for the required fields.

### Files Modified:

*   `src/screens/SongListScreen.js`: Updated the API endpoint and data mapping logic.
*   `assignment.md`: This file.
